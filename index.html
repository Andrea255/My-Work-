    Dear friend,
  I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try
  to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please
  don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am,
  and I really don't want you to do that. I will call people by different names or
  generic names because I don't want you to find me. I didn't enclose a return
  address for the same reason. I mean nothing bad by this. Honest.
  I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and
  doesn't try to sleep with people even if they could have. I need to know that
  these people exist.
